# CS-3340-Analysis-Of-Algorithms

Topics:
algorithm design basics: algorithm design with mathematical induction, asymptotic notation, and solving recurrence relations. • algorithm design techniques: divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking. • searching, sorting, and union-find. • trees and red-black trees. • string matching, sequence comparison, and Huffman codes. • graph algorithms. • NP-completeness.
